        It is also the only source of light and heat in the solar system.<br/><br/>
        The energy we get from the Sun is called solar energy.<br/><br/>
        The Sun is at the center of the solar system and all planets revolve around it.<br/><br/>
        Green plants on Earth use this solar energy to make food. The Sun is a star,<br/><br/>
