    <h1>The Sun</h1>
    <p>
        <b>The sun gives us light and energy.</b>
        <i>It is a huge ball of hot gases.</i>
        <u>It is also the only source of light and heat in the solar system.</u>
        The energy we get from the Sun is called solar energy.
        The Sun is at the center of the solar system and all planets revolve around it.<br/>
        Green plants on Earth use this solar energy to make food. The Sun is a star, 
        but have you ever wondered, why it looks bigger than other starts. Sirius, 
        which is twenty times brighter than the Sun, 
        looks much smaller because it is much farther away from the Earth.
    </p>
    <h1>Planets</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>The eight planets that are part of our solar</strong> system move around the Sun, 
        in a fixed elliptical path. This movement is called revolution. The path is called an orbit. 
        <em>The planets and their moons also spin around</em> an imaginary line called axis.<br/>
        Planets do not have any light of their own. They get their light an warmth from the Sun Mercury is 
        the closest planet to the Sun. It is also the hottest planet in the solar system. Neptune is farthest 
        from the Sun and therefor, the coldest planet in the solar system.
