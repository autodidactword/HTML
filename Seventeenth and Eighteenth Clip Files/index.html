        It is a huge ball of hot gases.
        It is also the only source of light and heat in the solar system.
        The energy we get from the Sun is called solar energy.
        The Sun is at the center of the solar system and all planets revolve around it.
        Green plants on Earth use this solar energy to make food. The Sun is a star,
        but have you ever wondered, why it looks bigger than other starts. Sirius, 
        which is twenty times brighter than the Sun, 
        looks much smaller because it is much farther away from the Earth.
